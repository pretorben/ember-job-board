## Document It

Your repository must include a `readme.md` that answers the following questions regarding your subject. No need to write a book!

- Why did you choose this subject?
  - How were you first made aware of it?
    - this lab
- What problem does it solve?
  - build a website in a heartbeat with much less risk of dumb and/or crazy-making time-consuming syntactical errors
  - How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
    - it puts wrappers around common tasks, like creating routes and models
- Why does one use it?
  - ~instant gratification
  - writes code that writes code, and that improves my qualify of living with less hair-pulling
  - wicked easy fast install
  - does a lot for you:
    - creates development server
    - compiles Template
    - minfies
    - you can use es6 via Babel
    - writes test cases
    - customizes a README file
    - uses handlebars
    - uses reusable components
    - like Node it senses file changes and recompiles, reloads page backgroundedly
  - appears well-documented
  - What are the alternatives?
    - rails
    - angular
      - there must be downfalls, but for quick turnaround this is much better easier faster than angular.
      - maybe there's a tradeoff in volume, scaling, complexity, dont know, yet.
  - What is it similar to, if anything?
    - rails
- What is the history of this technology?
  - Who built it and why?
  - Who is maintaining it?
- What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
  - :o) it's a total relief.  it does a lot of stuff under the hood that should be done under the hood and not subject to us missing commas and braces and brackets and losing our minds thereto.  why, it's almost computer-y
- What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
- What resources do you recommend for interested students?
https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.12.0/getting-started/quick-start/

  - What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
- What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

- Run your example.
  - http://localhost:4200  this worked immediately, even before running the build ixn:

  - Do I need to run `bower install`?
    - we didn't need to run bower or install, but there is a bower.json file there
  Do I need an API key?
- Use your subject.
